Expectations in CMSC 100

I expect CMSC 100 Lab to be difficult and tricky to learn because it has many items that need to be memorized to work efficiently. However, I also expect that it will be beneficial to learn to maximize efficiency for us to learn more about working together.

Yes, I agree with your expectations Marc.
